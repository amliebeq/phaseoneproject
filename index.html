        <p>The Consumer Price Index measures the overall change in consumer prices based on a representative basket of goods and services over time.</p>
        <h3 id="importantlink">Why is it important?</h3>
        <p>The CPI is often used to adjust consumers' income payments (for example, Social Security), to adjust income eligibility levels for government assistance, and to automatically provide cost-of-living wage adjustments to millions of American workers</p>
